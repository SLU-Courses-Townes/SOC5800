I am currently taking CADC classes and about three hours a day of self care.

This is a lot of the reason I chose to pursue Alcohol and Drug Counseling for further education.

I also had Partakers (Arthur Banbury 617-795-2724) who I met through the prison education  program and funded the CLEP and DSST exams I needed to earn the credits necessary to complete my BA from BU.","The crime I committed involved a motor vehicle and, as a result, I do not drive. My family, who were to be my support system, all live in the suburbs where there is public transportation but it is not like the city. For instance, it stops at 6 PM so I cannot use it to attend most AA meetings or to take a job in the evening. The transition from Masshealth from my Pre release job at Smashburger to working in E-Waste Recycling where I make twice as much but still just barely enough to live on my own without state assistance of any other kind. When it was cancelled and, out of nowhere the connector care program wanted me to produce $250 a month for the premium and $50.00 a week for my therapist whom I had been making progress with over months. I tried to do it but I had already budgeted as much as I could to afford my apartment and some art supplies. After two months of borrowing and failing, I had to stop seeing my therapist and accept I will pay a penalty or whatever happens now. I had to stop therapy. Huge obstacle. I regressed a lot. If I did not work for family I would have been fired. Absolutely. As I knew my family would help with more school if the cost was not too much, I found that I could take classes to prepare for my CADC licence to help people like myself, eventually, but honestly, I went to help myself. I now have 6 of 10 classes complete and the psychological value is still growing. I got lucky. Probably the worst obstacle though was when I would count on any consistency or fairness in the probation system. I am on for 10 years. My two officers, since release Feb 2018, are great people as far as I can tell but the system is awful. I was told the day of my release a schedule of what would happens. For instance, if I did all I was supposed to and had no violations or negative police contact, after 6 months my appointments with the PO would go from every 14 days to every 30. So I marked the calendar and set my attitude and 6 months later thought this may actually happen. It happened a year and three months later. And then when I got the good news that I would only see him once a month, I also got the news that there was a new system and it was ""nothing to do with me"" but rather than the random in office breathalizers we have been doing all year and three months which I never failed, Now I must call a phone number. Every morning. And put in a code and if they tell me, I have to go to test right next to his office. So you got this. 1 year 3 months. 0 infractions. And the reward for my consistency in correction is to go from thinking of my PO and status as a criminal from twice a month to every day when I call, plus, I STILL have to physically go to the place twice a month. The Department of Correction is probably my biggest obstacle to Correction. And no help to mental health stability.","Housing, employment, Once I got a therapist, emotional support","My interactions suffered when I would count on any consistency or fairness in the probation system.
