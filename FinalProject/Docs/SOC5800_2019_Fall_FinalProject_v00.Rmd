## Introduction
This is an R Notebook for a study that examines how formerly incarcerated individuals who successfully reintegrated cope with barriers to re-entry.  This study was conducted as a team project for the SOC 5800 Survey Design and Sampling course during the Fall 2019 semester at Saint Louis University.

## Project Set Up
The following code chunk enables the R Notebook to integrate seamlessly with the project organization format. This is normally included in the R Notebook to simplify file calls and enable file portability but it has been causing an error. To work around this problem, I've embedded the `here()` function where I enter a file path when necessary.

```{r setup-project, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

## Load Dependencies
The following code chunk loads package dependencies required to perform the necessary tasks. Basic tasks include importing, reading, wrangling, and cleaning data; selecting a subset of the data; checking for unique observations; analyzing missing data; and performing various types of regression analyses. 
```{r load-dependencies, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # loads the basic R packages
library(here) # enables file portability
library(readr) # functions for reading data
library(dplyr) # functions for data wrangling
library(janitor) # functions for data cleaning
library(naniar) # functions for analyzing missing data
library(expss) # functions for calculating on values
library(ggplot2) # functions for data visualizations
library(boot) # functions for regression analysis
library(ordinal) # functions for regression models for ordinal data
library(MASS) # functions for ordered logistic or probit regression
library(broom) # functions for tidying ordinal logistic regression models
library(gvlma) # functions for global validation of linear model assumptions
library(lmtest) # functions for testing linear regression models
library(leaps) # functions for regression subset selection
library(car) # companion to applied regression
library(aod) # functions to analyze overdispersed data counts and proportions
library(pscl) # contains function for pseudo R2 measures for logistic regression
library(ResourceSelection) # contains function for Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test
```

## Load Raw Data
The following code chunk imports the raw data from the `csv` file.
```{r import-data, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dataRaw <- read.csv(here("DataRaw","SOC5800_Data_NumericValues_CSV.csv"), 
                      sep = ",", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, dec = ".")
```

## Clean Data
The following code chunk performs several actions to clean the raw data.
```{r clean-data}
